## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ mkdir themes
    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/dt801ts/sublime-hugo-theme.git

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Setup

### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/dt801ts/sublime-hugo-theme/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/dt801ts/sublime-hugo-theme/exampleSite/config.toml).

To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](//github.com/dt801ts/sublime-hugo-theme/master/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change strings as you like to customize your website.


### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

    $ hugo server

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
